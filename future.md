# Future additions

This section details some of many possible ways of improving the game.

## Crafting system

Crafting system will play a large role in the game's economy. It will introduce the ability to combine resources into consumables and equipment. The crafting update will also introduce resource nodes, which provide additional means of generating resources, in addition to quests and spoils of battle.

The process of gathering from a resource node will involve answering a query similar to the one used in battle. This provides the player with an option to practice without significant consequences for failure.

## Expansions

Expansions will typically introduce new sets of kanji characters into the game, new gameplay areas and quests. I believe the expansions should be offered as a stand-alone product so that players with intermediate knowledge of Japanese can skip the learning process for kanji they have already memorized. However, I think the expansions should introduce a gameplay mechanic for practising kanji from previous expansions and the base game. Although they can be played through in any order, the persistence module will keep track of progress across all expansions.

### Multiplayer

One interesting functionality an expansion can bring is the addition of a multiplayer element. There are two possible approaches. One is to introduce player profiles, which would contain achievements and statistical data such as the list of most challenging kanji for that particular player. The other is to allow for player vs. player combat, cooperative play and other complex functionality.

## Other versions

As the game's design is modular, it would be very easy to create a Chinese version of the game that uses Pinyin romanization instead of hiragana. We also have plans for a demo, which would teach the player hiragana characters, thus making the game more accessible to complete beginners in Japanese.
