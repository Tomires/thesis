# Introduction

Modern technologies enable students to acquire new language skills with relative ease compared to traditional means. Many have taken up this opportunity and released pioneering educational software, which takes advantage of contemporary personal computers and, perhaps most importantly, smart devices. Although a lot of these products employ features that make them appealing to use, few come close to immersion found in traditional videogame products, a characteristic which is of paramount importance to user retention and in turn effectiveness of these solutions in the long term.

The purpose of this thesis is to draw from the best game design, programming and educational practices and to ultimately create a prototype of a full-fledged interactive videogame experience that facilitates learning Japanese kanji characters.

The game is a joint project between myself and my friend David Nguyen, a student of Art & Design at Prague College, who is involved in the process of creating the vast majority of graphical assets used within the game.

## Japanese writing system

In this subsection we introduce the Japanese writing system. Contemporary Japanese language makes use of the following three types of scripts in addition to Latin characters.

### Kanji

Kanji are adopted logographic Chinese characters. They are the main building blocks of Japanese language used to refer to most objects and actions. In contrast with Chinese, which only features one way of pronunciation, Japanese includes two distinct styles of reading - on'yomi and kun'yomi. The on'yomi reading refers to a phonetic approximation of the original Chinese pronunciation, whereas kun'yomi is the Japanese reading of kanji. Kun'yomi are generally used when the kanji is present either in a stand-alone manner or in combination with hiragana characters. This can be observed in most verbs. On'yomi, on the other hand, are used in kanji compounds.

### Hiragana

Hiragana is one of the two syllabaries used in Japanese. It is used in forming grammatic constructs and additionally can be utilised in place of kanji for obsolete or more difficult kanji in the form of furigana. This practice is common with academic textbooks for younger students and non-native speakers.

### Katakana

Katakana is the other Japanese syllabary used exclusively for transcription of words originated in other languages, most commonly English and German. Some words are not transcribed into katakana, but are instead written using their original Latin form.

## Chapters

The thesis is comprised of the following chapters.

### Analysis

In this section we analyse examples of gaming and non-gaming software products that aim to teach the user Japanese in one form or another. We discuss their learning elements and game mechanics or gamification elements that support the educational framework. We also take a look at two examples from the turn-based role-playing game genre and analyze their combat mechanics. We conclude the chapter by selecting features that would form the basis for our game.

### Requirements

Includes specification of functional and non-functional requirements for our game.

### Technology

In this section we introduce tools that are used during development of the game. We take a look at the game engine used and some of the reasons behind choosing it, the external map editor and the reasoning as to why use one, data storage formats for storing many structures included within the game and a version control system used during development.

### Battle system

Includes description of combat mechanics, the learning and the challenge systems used in the game, a diagram detailing communication between components and a detailed description of these components and data structures exclusive to the battle portion of the game.

### Exploration system

Details the questing system used within our game, introduces the item system and item economy and talks about the experience system. As with the battle section, we discuss data structures and script components exclusive to this part of the game.

### Shared elements

Contains information on data structures and script components used outside of and in both the battle and exploration parts of the game. Details the persistence module and the used tile rendering algorithm.

### Tutorial

Details the process of introducing the player to key gameplay mechanics via a series of images that guide the player to perform specific actions.

### Testing

Includes lessons learnt from user testing the game on two subjects.

### Future additions

This section details some of many possible ways of improving the game.

### Conclusion

We discuss the current state of the the game's implementation and issues encountered.
