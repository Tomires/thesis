# Introduction

Modern technologies enable students to acquire new language skills with relative ease compared to traditional means. Many have taken up this opportunity and released pioneering educational software, which takes advantage of contemporary personal computers and, perhaps most importantly, smart devices. Although a lot of these products employ features that make them appealing to use, few come close to immersion found in traditional videogame products, a characteristic which is of paramount importance to user retention and in turn effectiveness of these solutions in the long term.

The purpose of this thesis is to draw from the best game design, programming and educational practices and to ultimately create a prototype of a full-fledged interactive videogame experience that facilitates learning Japanese kanji characters.

## Japanese writing system

Contemporary Japanese language makes use of the following three types of scripts in addition to latin characters.

### Kanji

Kanji are adopted logographic Chinese characters. They are the main building blocks of Japanese language used to refer to most objects and actions. In contrast with Chinese, which only features one way of pronunciation, Japanese includes two distinct styles of reading - on'yomi and kun'yomi. The on'yomi reading refers to a phonetic approximation of the original Chinese pronunciation, whereas kun'yomi is the Japanese reading of kanji. Kun'yomi are generally used when the kanji is present either in a stand-alone manner or in combination with hiragana characters. This can be observed in most verbs. On'yomi, on the other hand, are used in kanji compounds.

### Hiragana

Hiragana is one of the two syllabaries used in Japanese. It is used in forming grammatic constructs and additionally can be utilised in place of kanji for obsolete or more difficult kanji in the form of furigana. This practice is common with academic textbooks for younger students and non-native speakers.

[syllabary - a set of written characters each of which is used to represent a syllable]

### Katakana

Katakana is the other Japanese syllabary used exclusively for transcription of words originated in other languages, most commonly English and German. Some words are not transcribed into katakana, but are instead written using their original latin form.
